# Image filters effects
 
The purpose of the filter and effect is to enhance or change image properties, and to extract information from images such as edges, corners, and blemishes. Images become more visually attractive with filters and effects. Methods and libraries such as sobel edge detection filter, changing the color scale of the picture, blur filters such as mean filter, median filter, gaussian blur, have been developed for filtering and effect operations. The effect creates a smoother image by removing sharp features from the image. The light value of the image or the color value in the pixel is changed with the effect. It aimed to make the images look more beautiful by developing filters and effects.


With the .py file, hints about the designed functions and necessary functions are given. Since the file is basically not designed for the application, the functions contain operations for them. You can ignore them. Also, I've given the names of most filters and effects. So filters with these names normally don't exist and I haven't tried to do them
